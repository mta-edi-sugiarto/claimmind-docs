## Overview

This section provides a human-readable overview of the most critical data models used throughout the ClaimMind API. While the OpenAPI specification offers detailed schemas, this guide focuses on explaining the purpose of each model and its key fields, helping you understand the data you will be sending and receiving.

Understanding these data models is crucial for designing your applications to interact seamlessly with the ClaimMind API.

## Core Data Models

### OCRClaimsRequest
Used to create a new claim record in the system.

*   **`claim_id` (String)**: A unique identifier for the claim.
*   **`claim_code` (String, Optional)**: A human-readable code for the claim.

### OCRTriggerRequest
Used to trigger an OCR workflow for a claim, typically for PII extraction.

*   **`claim_id` (String)**: The identifier of the claim to process.
*   **`claim_code` (String, Optional)**: A human-readable code for the claim.
*   **`base64` (String, Optional)**: A base64 encoded string of the document to be processed.
*   **`raw_input` (String, Optional)**: Raw text input to be processed.
*   **`workflow_id` (String, Optional)**: An existing workflow ID to use.

### OCRTriggerResponse
The generic response structure when a workflow like claim creation or OCR is triggered.

*   **`claim_id` (UUID, Optional)**: The claim ID that was processed.
*   **`tenant_id` (UUID, Optional)**: The organization (tenant) to which this claim belongs.
*   **`status` (String, Optional)**: The status of the workflow.
*   **`message` (String, Optional)**: A descriptive message about the workflow status.
*   **`workflow_id` (String, Optional)**: The ID of the workflow run that was initiated.
*   **`result` (Object, Optional)**: The detailed result of the processing.

### UserResponse
Represents a user within an organization (tenant).

*   **`id` (UUID)**: Unique identifier for the user.
*   **`keycloak_id` (String)**: Identifier from the Keycloak authentication system.
*   **`name` (String)**: Full name of the user.
*   **`username` (String)**: Username for login.
*   **`email` (String)**: User's email address.
*   **`tenant_id` (UUID)**: The organization (tenant) the user belongs to.
*   **`role_id` (UUID)**: Identifier for the user's role.
*   **`phone_number` (String, Optional)**: User's phone number.
*   **`channel_access` (Array of Strings, Optional)**: List of channels the user has access to.
*   **`status` (String)**: User's account status (e.g., "active", "inactive").

### TenantResponse
Represents a tenant (organization) in the system.

*   **`id` (UUID)**: Unique identifier for the tenant.
*   **`name` (String)**: Name of the tenant.
*   **`domain` (String, Optional)**: The domain associated with the tenant.

### ClaimValidatorRequest
The payload for triggering a claim validation workflow.

*   **`input_data` (Object)**: An object containing the data needed for validation, including `claim_id`, `tenant_id`, `claim_markdown`, and `patient_profile`.

### ClaimValidatorResponse
The response structure after triggering a claim validation.

*   **`claim_id` (String, Optional)**: The claim ID that was validated.
*   **`workflow_id` (String, Optional)**: The ID of the workflow run for this validation.
*   **`status` (String, Optional)**: The status of the validation process.
*   **`result` (Object, Optional)**: The detailed result of the claim validation.

### ICDResultPushRequest
The payload for pushing ICD results to a claim.

*   **`claim_id` (UUID)**: The claim ID to which the ICD result belongs.
*   **`full_json` (Object)**: The complete JSON object containing the ICD result data.

## Relationships

*   A **Claim** is identified by a `claim_id` and is the central entity for workflows.
*   Workflows like **OCR**, **Validation**, and **ICD Coding** are triggered for a specific **Claim**.
*   **Users** belong to a **Tenant** (Organization).
*   Responses like **OCRTriggerResponse** and **ClaimValidatorResponse** provide the status and `workflow_id` for the initiated processes.

This overview should provide a solid foundation for understanding the data structures within the ClaimMind API. For precise field definitions and constraints, always refer to the OpenAPI specification.
