## Overview

This section provides a human-readable overview of the most critical data models used throughout the ClaimMind API. While the OpenAPI specification offers detailed schemas, this guide focuses on explaining the purpose of each model and its key fields, helping you understand the data you will be sending and receiving.

Understanding these data models is crucial for designing your applications to interact seamlessly with the ClaimMind API.

*   **`goal_code` (String)**: The primary goal of the workflow (e.g., "OCR", "ICD_CODER", "VALIDATION").
*   **`version` (Integer)**: Version of the workflow definition used.
*   **`trigger_type` (String)**: How the workflow was initiated (e.g., "manual", "auto").

### OCRFullResponse
The response structure for a full OCR process initiation.

*   **`claim_id` (UUID)**: The claim ID for which OCR was initiated.
*   **`workflow_id` (String)**: The ID of the workflow run that handles this OCR process.

## Relationships

*   A **Claim** is associated with a **Payer** and a **PayerType**.
*   **Users** belong to a **Tenant** (Organization).
*   **WorkflowRuns** are typically initiated for a specific **Claim** and may process a **Document**.
*   **OCRFullResponse**, **ClaimValidatorResponse**, and **ICDResultPushRequest** are all related to the processing and validation of a **Claim**.

This overview should provide a solid foundation for understanding the data structures within the ClaimMind API. For precise field definitions and constraints, always refer to the OpenAPI specification.
