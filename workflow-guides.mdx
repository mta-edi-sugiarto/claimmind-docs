## Overview

The ClaimMind API orchestrates complex medical claim processing through a series of automated workflows. This section provides practical, step-by-step guides for common end-to-end scenarios, demonstrating how different API endpoints work together to achieve a complete business process.

These guides are designed to help you understand the flow of data and operations, enabling you to integrate ClaimMind workflows seamlessly into your applications.

## Available Workflows

Here are the detailed workflow guides:

*   [Getting General Information](/workflow-guides/getting-general-information)
*   [Insert New Claim](/workflow-guides/insert-new-claim)
*   [Retrieve Documents Information](/workflow-guides/retrieve-documents-information)
*   [Process ICD](/workflow-guides/process-icd)
*   [Process Claim Validation](/workflow-guides/process-claim-validation)

## End-to-End Workflow: Claim Submission to Validation

This guide illustrates the typical workflow for submitting a new claim, processing its associated documents via OCR, processing ICD codes, and then triggering a validation process.

### Prerequisites
*   An authenticated `access_token`.
*   A base64 encoded document (e.g., a scanned medical bill or insurance form) to be processed.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Create a New Claim">
First, create a new claim in the system. This will provide you with a `claim_id` that you will use for subsequent workflow steps.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST "{api_base_url}/v1/claims/create" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "claim_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "claim_code": "NEW-CLAIM-001"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="2. Process OCR for PII">
With the `claim_id`, you can now trigger the OCR workflow to process the claim's associated document. Provide the document as a base64 encoded string.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST "{api_base_url}/v1/workflows/ocr/pii/create" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "claim_id": "YOUR_CLAIM_ID",
  "base64": "BASE64_ENCODED_DOCUMENT_DATA"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="3. Process ICD">
After OCR processing, you can trigger the ICD processing workflow.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST "http://api.vm01-ext.claimmind.dev.keycenter.ai/v1/workflows/icd/create" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "module": "MODULE_ICD",
    "input_data": {
        "claim_id": "YOUR_CLAIM_ID"
    }
}'
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="4. Process Claim Validation">
Finally, trigger the claim validation workflow. This will check the claim against predefined rules.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.vm01-ext.claimmind.dev.keycenter.ai/cl-service/v1/workflows/validation/create" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "input_data": {
    "claim_id": "YOUR_CLAIM_ID",
    "tenant_id": "YOUR_TENANT_ID",
    "claim_markdown": "Extracted markdown content from OCR (or manual input)",
    "patient_profile": {
      "icd10_list": [],
      "icd9_list": [],
      "ina_cbg": null
    }
  }
}'
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>
