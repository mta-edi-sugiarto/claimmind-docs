## Overview

This section provides definitions for essential terms and concepts related to the ClaimMind API and the broader domain of medical claim processing. Familiarizing yourself with this glossary will help you better understand the API's functionalities and integrate them effectively into your applications.

## Core Concepts

### Claim Lifecycle
The complete journey of a medical claim, from its initial submission and processing through various stages like OCR, medical coding, validation, and final resolution. The ClaimMind API supports and automates various steps within this lifecycle.

### ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision)
A globally recognized system of medical classification codes used to report diagnoses and procedures. The ClaimMind API integrates with ICD coding to ensure accurate and compliant claim processing.

### OCR Blocks
In the context of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), "blocks" refer to structured segments of text or data identified and extracted from a document. These blocks can represent specific fields, paragraphs, or tables.

### Workflow Run
An instance of an automated process or sequence of tasks executed within the ClaimMind API. Workflows can include steps like OCR processing, ICD coding, and claim validation, and each execution is logged as a "workflow run."

## Glossary

*   **Access Token**: A credential that grants access to protected API resources. Obtained after successful user authentication.
*   **API Base URL**: The root URL for all API endpoints (e.g., `https://api.vm01-ext.claimmind.dev.keycenter.ai/cl-service`).
*   **Claim Code**: A unique identifier assigned to a medical claim within the system.
*   **Claim ID**: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for a specific claim.
*   **Claim Validation**: The automated process of checking a claim against a set of predefined rules to ensure accuracy, completeness, and compliance.
*   **HTTP Status Codes**: Standardized codes returned by the API to indicate the success or failure of a request (e.g., 200 OK, 401 Unauthorized, 422 Unprocessable Entity).
*   **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Technology used to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images, into editable and searchable data.
*   **Refresh Token**: A long-lived credential used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
