## Prerequisites

Before you begin integrating with the ClaimMind API, ensure you have the following:

*   **API Base URL**: The base URL for the ClaimMind API (e.g., `https://mta.tech/claimmind`).
*   **Authentication Credentials**: Obtain your `username` and `password` for API authentication.
*   **Tenant ID**: Your unique `X-Tenant-Id` header, required for most API calls to identify your organization.
*   **User ID**: Your unique `X-User-Id` header, required for certain workflow-related API calls.

## Making Your First API Call

This section guides you through authenticating and making your first request to the ClaimMind API.

### Step 1: Obtain an Access Token

To interact with the ClaimMind API, you first need to authenticate and obtain an access token.

<Steps>
<Step title="Send a login request">
Make a `POST` request to the `/v1/auth/login` endpoint with your `username` and `password`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST "{api_base_url}/v1/auth/login" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "username=your_username&password=your_password"
```

```python
import requests

api_base_url = "https://mta.tech/claimmind" # Replace with your actual API base URL
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

response = requests.post(
    f"{api_base_url}/v1/auth/login",
    data={"username": username, "password": password},
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
)
print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
A successful response will return an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`. Store the `access_token` securely, as it will be used for subsequent authenticated requests.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: List Payer Types

Once you have an access token, you can start making authenticated requests. Let's try listing the available payer types.

<Steps>
<Step title="Send a request to list payer types">
Make a `GET` request to the `/v1/payer-type` endpoint, including your `access_token` in the `Authorization` header.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X GET "{api_base_url}/v1/payer-type" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```python
import requests

api_base_url = "https://mta.tech/claimmind" # Replace with your actual API base URL
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" # Replace with your obtained access token

response = requests.get(
    f"{api_base_url}/v1/payer-type",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
)
print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
A successful response will return a list of payer types, such as `BPJS`, `Insurance`, or `OOP`.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Create a Claim

Now, let's create a new medical claim. This requires your `X-Tenant-Id` header.

<Steps>
<Step title="Send a request to create a claim">
Make a `POST` request to the `/v1/claims` endpoint, including your `access_token` and `X-Tenant-Id` header, along with the claim details in the request body.

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST "{api_base_url}/v1/claims" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_TENANT_ID" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "claim_code": "CLM-20250824-001",
  "payer_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "payer_type": "insurance",
  "payers_plafon": 5000000
}'
```

```python
import requests
import uuid

api_base_url = "https://mta.tech/claimmind" # Replace with your actual API base URL
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" # Replace with your obtained access token
tenant_id = "YOUR_TENANT_ID" # Replace with your actual tenant ID

claim_data = {
    "claim_code": "CLM-20250824-001",
    "payer_id": str(uuid.uuid4()), # Replace with an actual payer ID
    "payer_type": "insurance",
    "payers_plafon": 5000000
}

response = requests.post(
    f"{api_base_url}/v1/claims",
    json=claim_data,
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
        "X-Tenant-Id": tenant_id,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
)
print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
A successful response will return the details of the newly created claim, including its unique `id`.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
